# FUP â€“ A simple tool for putting files up.

**fup** is a simple command-line tool for sharing links to files. It uses a
hash of a file's creation date & your email address to act as a unique file
ID and keep everything in sync.

- âœ¨ Share a unique URL to a file by running `fup myfile.png`
- ðŸ”— If the file's already up, `fup myfile.png` copies the link
- ðŸ—‘ Delete the remote version of a file with `fup -d myfile.png`

## Setup

You'll need an AWS S3-compatible object storage bucket. I recommend using
Digital Ocean Spaces for ease of use.

Build and install with `./build.sh`.

Before running, create a `~/.fup` file with the following in JSON format:

```
{
  "ID": <your email address>,
  "AWS_KEY": <your aws key>,
  "AWS_SECRET": <your aws secret>,
  "AWS_ENDPOINT": <your aws endpoint as an https:// url>,
  "AWS_BUCKET": <your aws bucket name>,
  "CUSTOM_DOMAIN": <custom domain for your bucket (optional)>
}
```
